TODO:

Potential features:

- 'remember me' persistent logins using a cookie
- multiple user emails (= institutional affiliations) for a user, like in facebook
- allow users to re-register to an email if unactivated?
- cascading authorization schemes (like merb-auth's strategies?)
- per-project email tailoring (esp. point to useful url with notification of a grant)

Outstanding items:

- specs for controllers (pending Merb improvements to url generation in slices)
