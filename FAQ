=Nascent Repertoire Core FAQ=


Q. How do I change the layout for the registration/etc pages, respond-to email address?

A. In init.rb:

Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
  Merb::Slices::config[:repertoire_core][:layout]     ||= :my_admin_layout     # layout for your own registration/password pages
  Merb::Slices::config[:repertoire_core][:email_from] ||= 'repertoire@mit.edu'
end


Q. How do I add or replace user lookup services?

A. By default, Repertoire core looks up user domains in the Whois database when they activate their email address.  This allows it to associate users with institutions, robustly offloading the task of checking credentials and other security to the institution's
email login system.  (Kudos to Facebook for figuring out such a low-maintenance and difficult to spoof system for determining institutional
credentials.)  To add another user identification service, declare a helper class that updates the user's fields and returns a non-nil
value on success.

class MyLookupHelper
  def lookup!(user)
    case user.email    # a real example would probably access an outside directory service (e.g. ldap or finger)
    when /@mit.edu$/: user.institution_code = "MIT-2"
    else nil
    end
  end
end

Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
  Merb::Slices::config[:repertoire_core][:lookup_helpers] << MyLookupHelper.new
end

The lookup handler polls helpers in order, stopping when one succeeds.  You can clear the list of handlers to disable lookup, replace
it with you own to disable the defaults, or rearrange the polling order.


Q. How do I use a different SMTP mail server?

A. In init.rb:

Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
  ....
  Merb::Mailer.config = {
    :host   => 'smtp.gmail.com',          # example: use google mail smtp instead of MIT
    :port   => '587',
    :user   => 'repertoire.hyperstudio',
    :pass   => '77MassAve',
    :auth   => :plain
  }
end


Q. How do I add project-specific information about users to the data model?

A. This is why Repertoire Core mixes its own fields into your user model.  Simply add a new table to store 
your per-project info, and then add an association to the user model in your application.  For example,

class User
  include DataMapper::Resource
  include RepertoireCore::Mixins::User

  property :id, Serial

  has n, :enrollments																					# project-specific
  has n, :courses,         :through => :enrollments           # ditto
end

You can also add your own methods to the user model.  Don't add new properties: instead use a 1-to-1 relation to
your project-specific user data, which is stored in your project's PostgreSQL schema.


Q. How do I redirect to another URL after user activation (or signup/password reset/etc.)?

A. The same way that merb-auth-password-slice allows you to define 'after' controller filters to redirect on login and logout.
Repertoire Core comes with controller stubs set up for exactly this.  Install them with 'rake slices:repertoire_core:stubs' 
and modify the controller mixins in the 'slices/repertoire_core' directory.


Q. The default registration/profile/password pages are plain and ugly.  How do I reconfigure them?

A. Override the default CSS in your project's stylesheets.  First set the layout to your own project-specific design.  Then define a new containing id to surround the entire page contents.  Define CSS styles relative to it.  These styles will always override the ones
defined in the Repertoire Core files.  You can also use jquery to add new functionality to the existing pages.  Or see Merb slice
documentation for info on completely over-riding views.


Q. Can I access Repertoire core's administrative functions as a web service?

A. Yes.  The controller methods are written to render HTML pages or for use with ajax web services.  With the exception of the form
validation actions, the latter approach is untested, however.


Q. How do I get the default login page to use same layout as the rest of the pages?

A. The login page uses the application layout unless specified otherwise.  You can copy the Repertoire core layout into your layouts
directory if necessary.


Q. How do I require login for a given page?

A. Repertoire core delegates authentication to the merb-auth-slice-password plugin.  The README in its source will give detailed information.  But in general, in routes.rb:

  authenticate do
    resource :posts
  end


Q. How do I require authorization for a given page?

A. Use a before controller filter that checks whether session.user has one of the necessary roles

before :ensure_authorized, :with => [:system_administrator, :message => 'You need sysadmin role to remove the hard drive']


Q. Sure, that provides access control over actions, but what's the best way to avoid presenting users with the unavailable
options in the first place?

A. The most direct way is with conditional erb:

<% if session.user.has_role?(:sysadmin) %>
  <div id="delete_everything_tab">...</div>
<% end %>

But over time that litters your views with progressively more and more authorization logic.  Another approach is to offload
the task to css.  List all of the user's role names in classes on a containing div, and display only the controls that are
valid for the user's given roles:

... In the view:
<div class="sysadmin ber_member">                                                                                         <!-- complete list of user's roles.
 there's a view helper:
                                                                   <div class="<%= roles_css(session.user) %>">... -->
  <div id="delete_everything_tab" class="control">...</div>   <!-- only for admins -->
  <div id="contribute_tab"        class="control">...</div>   <!-- only for members -->
  <div id="browse_tab"            class="control">...</div>   <!-- for guests and others -->
</div>

... In the css:
.control                           { display: none; }                           /* default to controls invisible */
.sysadmin   #delete_everything_tab { display: block; }      /* visible to sysadmins */
.ber_member #contribute_tab        { display: block; }      /* visible to ber_members */
.guest      #browse_tab            { display: block; }      /* visible to guests */

The advantage to this is that it's completely declarative, easy to maintain, and keeps logic out of your views.  The downside
is that users can see your application's security structure in the html source.  (But you did declare authorization filters
on the controller to actually keep them out, right?...)


Q. Does Repertoire core have routing extensions, or only controller filters for authorization?

A. For now, only controller filters.


Q. How do I make a role closed to subscription or granting other than what I do at the command line.  Conversely, 
how do I make a role that can be joined without a review process.

A.                     granted_by not set | granted_by is set
                     ---------------------|----------------------------
   not subscribable  | closed membership  | can only be granted
       subscribable  | open membership    | can be granted & subscribed


Q. Is there only a single namespace for roles, across all projects?

A. Yes.  Early versions of the data model included a "project context" field that identified each role's project.  But it quickly became
clear that the project context and role name only occur together, and serve to identify a single system role.  Plus it invited confusion:
does "editor" in project "aop" mean the same thing as "editor" in project "ter"?  Probably not.

The conclusion was to use a single namespace for roles, and encourage projects to use prefixes: :ber_editor, cfrp_contributor, etc.


Q. Is there a quick way to reset a user's password?

A. Easiest way is to have them use the password reset by email feature.  BUT, in a pinch you can use the model API to modify accounts:

		# merb -i
		>> u = User.first(:email => 'user@company.com')
		>> u.password = u.password_confirmation = 'NEWPASSWORD'
		>> u.save!
		
There's absolutely no way to see a user's current password, since both it and the salt are md5 encrypted.  However, you can do all
basic user admin from the command line, including creating accounts, activating them, resetting passwords, and granting roles.  See the
User model API for details.


=Common Problems=

Q. I can't get Merb's login page to work, even though the registration and activation process is fine and I can find the user in the console.

A. Make sure merb-auth is configured to use User.email to identify users (in merb/merb-auth/setup.rb)


Q. I get a SMTP socket error when I test the registration pages on my workstation.

A. The system must have internet access in order to send emails.  (Not a problem on a production install, since the registration
pages are only available via the internet).
