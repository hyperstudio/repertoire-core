Installing Repertoire Core into your application gives you access to Hyperstudio user registration, password management, and authorization control features in your merb application.  It also provides a simple set of commonly-used libraries, e.g. jquery and jquery-ui, and Hyperstudio ajax plugins that extend them.

To install Repertoire Core:

# download and install the gem on your development workstation
git clone git@github.com:repertoire/repertoire-core.git
cd repertoire-core
sudo rake install

# add the slice as a regular dependency for your application (dependencies.rb)
dependency 'repertoire_core'

# alter your router to mount the Repertoire Core slice
Merb::Router.prepare do
  authenticate do
    ... your application routes that require login
  end

  slice(:merb_auth_slice_password)											                # i.e. user login/logout
  slice(:repertoire_core, :name_prefix => nil, :path_prefix => "")    # i.e. user registration/activation/profile/password mgmt
                                                        # see the merb slices documentation for info on name_prefix and path_prefix
end

# add the Repertoire user mixins to the default merb user (app/models/user.rb).  then comment out or delete the
# 'login' property, since Repertoire uses email logins.  Your entire user model might look like this:
class User
  include DataMapper::Resource
  include RepertoireCore::User
  property :id, Serial
# property :login, String    <<< n.b. commented out
end

# tell Merb's password login slice that you want to use User.email rather than User.login to identify users.  there's already a
configuration suggestion to do this - just uncomment it (merb/merb-auth/setup.rb)
Merb::Plugins.config[:"merb-auth"][:login_param]    = :email

# Insure that your database is set up according to Repertoire standards, with your application tables loaded into a 
# separate PostgreSQL schema and connecting by a project-specific user.
# http://hyperstudio.mit.edu:81/groups/developer/wiki/c6a82/Repertoire_Database_Layout.html

# Alter database.yml to give the rake tasks access to your PostgreSQL public schema, which will store user, role, membership models:
# (Snippet below does not need to be configured)
rake:
  <<: *defaults
  repositories:
    core:
      # admin access to public repertoire core tables
      adapter:  postgresql
      database: hyperstudio_development
      username: postgres
      password: 
      host:     localhost

# run the rake install task to transfer templates and assets to your application and prime your database
rake slices:repertoire_core:install

# start up your application, and view the registration registration pages at http://localhost:4000/signup
# now would be a good time to double-check the email and database configuration by attempting to sign up for an account

# type rake audit:routes in your app for other relevant URLs

# N.B. do not run rake slices:repertoire_core:install on a production environment!!  It uses DataMapper auto_migrate, which will 
# immediately delete all of your users and roles.  Instead, use the task just once to set up the tables on the server, and thereafter
# you can re-use the ones that are already there.
